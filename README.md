# BigBrain 3D Classified Volumes

This dataset contains 3D classified volumes from the BigBrain release 2015
published in the [BigBrain Project website](https://bigbrainproject.org).

The volumes are available for several isotropic resolutions (100, 200, 300 and 400um) and classified for basic tissue classes:

- 0: background
- 1: CSF
- 2: cortical gray
- 3: white
- 4: cerebellum
- 5: layer 1 of cortex
- 6: sub-cortical gray
- 7: pineal gland
- 8: cerebellum/brainstem gray
- 9: cerebellum/brainstem white

## Reference and more information

The BigBrain dataset is the result of a collaborative effort between the
teams of Dr. Katrin Amunts and Dr. Karl Zilles (Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich)
and Dr. Alan Evans (Montreal Neurological Institute).
